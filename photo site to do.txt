think about a dependency injection i want to use

finish data methods - session and role implementations

download git hub


entity - data model, what we pull out of the database
repository - interface to database, like select, update, create, etc
unit of work = what we use to do db transactions
process = what we use to make these calls to the db, userprocess contains a unit of work that uses the user entity
newSession = _unitOfWork.Sessions.Add(newSession);
^  unit of work has all of your tables, it's saying add a new session to that table, it does all the sql magic, that's the entity framework / orm magic
- some core models will be extended to use for the view, like if you had an extra checkbox or something
