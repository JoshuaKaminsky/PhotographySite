- Create user accounts, set expiration date? set password?
- Manage discount groups, apply discounts to users
-> possibly make discounts more flexible, like shots are free but pay for prints, etc
- Upload pictures
- Choose pics from albums to display on Samples page
- Albums: either upload new pics or add from existing albums

-> keep in mind, when deleting photos from album, if it's the last album with that photo, delete actual photo, not just association
-> later we can add in ajax call for when pages are loading

Users:
- log in
- order pictures - by size, quantity, other options?... payment

General:
- display watermark over images? prevent right clicking

Cool Featurers:
- tags (create on the fly for photos & albums... user starts typing in words and the interface will automatically fill out with existing tags, or create new ones if they do not already exist)
-->  have a button for albums "Add Tags to Photos"
--> page that shows all tags and delete typos? or just make it harder to create, like create upon clicking "Add" instead of when they hit enter
- wowslider cool image transitions
